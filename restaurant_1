        	<h2> West Village</h2>
        	<h3> Perched on a winsome corner of the West Village, Chef Joey Campanaro's The Little Owl continues to hold a dear place in 
        	the hearts of diners near and far who appreciate that simple food and great food can be one and the same. The broccoli soup (a pure, silky pur√©e enriched with a trace of cream and crowned by a crouton 
        	of bubbling, aged cheddar) is among the best examples of this. The small corner room is quaint and despite this establishment's popularity, the service team is completely attitude-free. The wee kitchen is on display, and 
        	the focused crew turns out a rousing roster of preparations that may bear an affinity for Mediterranean cuisine such as seared cod with bagna cauda vinaigrette, and gravy meatball sliders, 
        	a hands-down house specialty.</h3>
